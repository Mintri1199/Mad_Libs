# Mad Libs 

This is an assignment for CS 1.1 class at Make School.

The objective of this assignment is to create a Mad Libs program that runs in the terminal. 

The complexity of this assignment is up to the students' experience.

### How to run this program

**Make sure** you have installed python3 and termcolor (A module that change the color of the text in terminal)

In your terminal

`git clone https://github.com/Mintri1199/Mad_Libs`

Open the project directory in your terminal 

Then input

`python3 Better_Mad_Libs.py`

Then follow the instructions shown on screen to enjoy some Mad libs

### Can I import other stories or make my own?

Yes you can but I highly advise not to do it for this program because it is very tedious.

But if you still want to do it then follow the steps below

1. Grab any mad lib from anywhere or make your own in a text file

2. Move the mad lib text file inside the project directory

3. Edit the text file so that the required part of speeches are replace with {}
