I walk through the color jungle. I take out my {} canteen. There's a {}
parrot with a {} {} in his mouth right there in front of me in the {} trees!
I gaze at his {} {}. A sudden sound awakes me from my daydream!
A panther’s {} in front of my head! I {} his {} breath. I remember I have a
packet of {} that makes go into a deep slumber! I {} it away from me in front
of the {}. Yes he's eating it! I {} away through the {} jungle. I meet my
parents at the tent. Phew! It’s been an exciting day in the jungle.
