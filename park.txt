Today, my fabulous camp group went to a (an) {}  amusement park.
It was a fun park with lots of cool {} and enjoyable play structures.
When we got there, my kind counselor shouted loudly, "Everybody off the {}."
We all pushed out in a terrible hurry. My counselor handed out yellow tickets,
and we scurried in. I was so excited! I couldn't figure out what exciting thing
to do first. I saw a scary roller coaster I really liked so, I {} ran over to
get in the long line that had about {} people in it. When I finally got on the
roller coaster I was {}. In fact I was so nervous my two knees were knocking
together. This was the {} ride I had ever been on! In about two minutes
I heard the crank and grinding of the gears. Thatâ€™s when the ride began! When
I got to the bottom, I was a little {} but I was proud of myself. The rest of
the day went {}. It was a(n) {} day at the fun park.
